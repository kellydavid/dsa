[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kellydavid/dsa.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kellydavid/dsa)

This is a project that implements common data structures and algorithms in the Java programming language. I created this
to refresh my knowledge of common ADTs and algorithms. I'm also using this as an opportunity to use the Junit framework 
and to also become familiar with travis.
